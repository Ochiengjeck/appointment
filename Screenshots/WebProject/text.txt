Creating a complete graduation application website involves several components and functionalities. 
While it's not feasible to provide a fully functional website within the limitations of this text-based 
platform, I can provide you with an outline of the key features and components that you would typically 
include in a graduation application website:

1. **Homepage**: Create an attractive and informative homepage that welcomes users and provides an
 overview of the graduation application process.

2. **User Registration and Login**: Implement a user registration and login system to allow students 
to create accounts and securely access their application details.

3. **Student Profile**: Provide a section where students can view and update their personal information, 
such as name, contact details, major, expected graduation date, etc.

4. **Application Form**: Design a graduation application form that collects essential details from students, 
such as degree program, courses completed, GPA, graduation date preference, honors/awards, etc.

5. **Document Upload**: Allow students to upload supporting documents, such as transcripts, recommendation 
letters, or any other required materials.

6. **Application Status Tracking**: Implement a system that enables students to track the progress of their 
application, including submission confirmation, review status, and approval/denial notifications.

7. **Payment Integration**: If there are any application fees, integrate a secure payment gateway for students 
to make online payments.

8. **Communication Channels**: Include a messaging system to facilitate communication between students and the 
graduation office, allowing students to ask questions, receive updates, or address any concerns related to 
their application.

9. **Administrative Backend**: Develop an administrative backend that allows authorized staff to manage and 
review student applications, update application statuses, communicate with students, and generate reports.

10. **Notification System**: Implement email notifications or push notifications to keep students informed 
about important updates, deadlines, and application milestones.

11. **FAQ and Help Center**: Create a comprehensive FAQ section or help center that addresses common questions 
and provides guidance on the graduation application process.

12. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure your website is mobile-friendly, allowing students to access and complete 
their graduation applications from various devices.

Remember, this is just a high-level overview, and building a fully functional graduation application website
 requires expertise in web development, database management, and user experience design. It's recommended to 
 consult with a professional web developer or development team to ensure a smooth and secure implementation of 
 your graduation application website.
